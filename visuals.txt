For F1 Racing Telemetry Analysis, you can build several Grafana visualizations using the data collected from the OpenF1 API. Here are some key ones:

1. Speed vs. Time Plot
Visualization Type: Time-series line chart

Metrics: Speed (km/h) over time

Insights: Identify speed fluctuations per lap

2. Throttle & Brake Usage Over Time
Visualization Type: Overlapping line charts

Metrics: Throttle (%) and Brake (%)

Insights: Understanding driver acceleration & braking patterns

3. Lap Time Comparison
Visualization Type: Bar chart

Metrics: Lap time per lap

Insights: Performance consistency across laps

4. Tire Degradation Over Laps
Visualization Type: Line chart

Metrics: Tire wear percentage

Insights: How tires degrade over multiple laps

5. G-Force Heatmap
Visualization Type: Heatmap

Metrics: Lateral & longitudinal G-forces

Insights: Detect high-speed corners and braking zones

6. Fuel Consumption Trend
Visualization Type: Line chart

Metrics: Fuel level per lap

Insights: Efficiency of fuel usage across a race

7. Sector Times Breakdown
Visualization Type: Stacked bar chart

Metrics: Sector 1, 2, and 3 times

Insights: Find strengths & weaknesses in different parts of the track

8. Overtake &   Position Changes
Visualization Type: Step chart

Metrics: Position change over laps

Insights: Track how a driver gains or loses positions
